## 🚀 Key Innovations

### 1. Dynamic Timetable & Relief Engine
Replaces manual, error-prone scheduling.
* **Conflict Detection:** Algorithmic validation of teacher, room, and subject availability.
* **Automated Relief Assignment:** Instantly suggests available faculty when a teacher marks an absence, ensuring zero unsupervised periods.

### 2. Predictive Progress Tracking (Dx Thinking)
Moving from reactive "End-of-Term" reports to live data.
* **Trend Analysis:** Automatically flags students with declining performance across multiple subjects.
* **Feedback Retention:** Digital archival of qualitative teacher comments to ensure the "learning journey" isn't lost when physical papers are.
